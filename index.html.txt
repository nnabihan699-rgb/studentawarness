                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Facing global issues like climate change, inequality, and resource depletion, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have a crucial role in shaping future leaders and promoting sustainability (SDG 4.7). The United Nations has integrated Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) into global education agendas, emphasizing the need for transformative learning that fosters values and behaviors for a sustainable future. Despite these efforts, a significant gap remains: student awareness is often inconsistent, and there is a lack of research on how various institutional and social factors influence this awareness, particularly in the Malaysian context.

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-4">2. Problem Statement</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The problem lies in the uneven awareness of sustainability concepts and initiatives among students in HEIs. While many institutions have integrated sustainability into their curricula and co-curricular activities, the effectiveness of these efforts on student awareness is not well understood. Existing research often focuses on knowledge rather than the attitudes and behaviors that drive true awareness. There is a need for a holistic model that connects external influences—such as lecturers, peers, activities, and information sources—to student attitudes, and ultimately, to their awareness of educational sustainability.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The literature review highlights that while sustainability has become a key agenda in HEIs, the effectiveness of these initiatives is a subject of ongoing debate. Studies by Wang et al. (2022) and Wong & Tan (2023) emphasize the importance of curriculum integration and individual motivation in promoting pro-environmental behavior. Warner & Elser (2015) found that certified green schools were more successful at integrating sustainability education. The review concludes that while previous studies have explored various aspects of sustainability education, a comprehensive model linking external factors to student awareness through the mediating role of attitudes, particularly in the Malaysian context, is needed.

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-4">6. Theoretical and Hypothesis Development. Conceptual Framework.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    This research is grounded in the Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory, which posits that individual values lead to beliefs about environmental issues, which in turn activate a sense of personal responsibility (norms) to act. Our conceptual framework extends this theory to the context of educational sustainability by proposing that external factors directly influence students' awareness.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The framework identifies <strong>Lecturer Experience on Sustainability, Peer Influence, Participation in Sustainability-related Activities, Curriculum Exposure, and Information Sources</strong> as the independent variables. These factors are proposed to have a direct effect on students' awareness.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Additionally, the framework suggests that student <strong>attitudes</strong> serve as a mediating variable, acting as a bridge between the external factors and students' awareness of educational sustainability. This means that the effect of the independent variables on awareness is also channeled through student attitudes.

                    The study concludes that student attitudes are the key mediator for awareness of educational sustainability. This finding emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach for HEIs that integrates both academic and social strategies. The research provides a practical guide for institutions to strengthen sustainability education by focusing on effective curriculum design, fostering positive peer engagement, and increasing participation in sustainability-related activities.
